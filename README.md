# Data Structures implemented in C

## Introduction
Despite being trying to get a job as a Python developer for a while, I wanted to get some practice with the C Programming Language and refresh my knowledge of Data Structures, as I can notice that lately I've been a little rusty on the subject. 

Here I'll keep my (somewhat noobish perhaps) implementations of some Data Structures. Starting with some of the basics, like a Dynamic Array and a Singly Linked List.

There is a chance I might write some implementations in other langues in the future, like C++, Rust, Go or Zig. But for now, I'll try to do most coding in C.
